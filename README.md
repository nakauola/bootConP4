Bootcon 2024 Project

What is this app and what is it for?

This script is a culmination of the learning we have done in these last months. We have chosen to try and approximate the popular tool Nmap in python, to expand our knowledge of the coding language and to gain deeper insight into how port scanning works from a coding perspective. The project here is intended to be built upon, and is a starting point for future practice coding security vulnerability scanners.

This is intended to be beginner or non-techie friendly, with a simple interface that walks you through step by step. This scan is intended to be used on a user's home network to enumerate open ports and their associated services, any usage beyond this scope is not condoned by the authors.

We utilized AI to help us understand why our novice code writing was not working, and how we could utilize new modules for our purposes. This helped us understand what was required for our code to work, and allowed us to learn much faster than we would have otherwise. The code you see here would not have worked as well without help, this was a big step up in scale than any code either of us had written before. AI served as a useful mentor understanding how to approach coding in python. We used this information to write and stitch together the modules you find in this code.

Please feel free to copy this code and use it!
